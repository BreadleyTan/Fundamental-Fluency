# Fundamental-Fluency

Some noticeable problems that I have observed

Firstly, the footer sometimes has a white horizontal line, sometimes it won't "stick", sometimes it just hovers at the bottom of the page
To solve this, make sure your divs are correct, as it arises from a problem with divs

To-Do:
Add contents page and hyperlinks to relevant pages (for events_competitions page, add expected month beside it)
    Especially for event-competition
Add more events if you can find them
Fill out the event_competition details more in-depth please
Parallax index.html page
update FFlogo hyperlink (navbar) to index.html instead of /
Resource page
change full list of resources hyperlink in navbar
Update Resources page to remove iframes (replace with screenshots)
continue work on New landing page


The summary buttons in the events_competitions webpage links directly to the ASR repo, so if you can't access it, you might have to update to the new relevant repo
