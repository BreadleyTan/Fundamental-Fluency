# Fundamental-Fluency

Some noticeable problems that I have observed

Firstly, the footer sometimes has a white horizontal line, sometimes it won't "stick", sometimes it just hovers at the bottom of the page

To-Do:
Add contents page and hyperlinks to relevant pages (for events_competitions page, add expected month beside it)
    Especially for event-competition
Add more events if you can find them


The summary buttons in the events_competitions webpage links directly to the ASR repo, so if you can't access it, you might have to update to the new relevant repo
